1. `matrix.py` This contains the begining of a `Matrix` class (which you will complete) as well as some helper functions `zeros` and `identity`. 
**This is the file we will be doing most of our work.**
  - 

2. `matrix_playground.ipynb` A notebook that imports our Matrix class and calls the test code. 

3. `matrix_cheat_sheet.ipynb` A juoyter notebook with a **glossary, explanation of matrix notation** and list of **matrix equations**. Use
this as a reference when filling out the methods in the `matrix` class!

4. `kalman_filter)demo.ipynb` We don't need do anything with this notebook.

5. `test.py` Contains test code which demonstrates the expected functionality of your code.

6. `datagenerator.py` this just contains some helper code which is used by the Kalman filter.
